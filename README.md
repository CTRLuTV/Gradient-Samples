# Gradient-Samples
Samples for Gradient, TensorFlow binding for .NET

**BasicMath**- creates two constant tensors and performs simple algebraic operations on them

**CharRNN** - generates semi-sensical text in the style of input. For example:
> LOST:
> What is your name beautiful princess?
>
> COMPUTER:
> Gradient your horn of exemity.
>
> GLOUCESTER:
> how one sick up scourish, thither place and thronds the grow for these bowing.
> 
> MARIANA:
> He shall speak not reverbering injurance.

**FashionMnistClassification** - standard TensorFlow example, that classifies small pictures of clothes.

**LinearSVM** - incomplete port due to a bug with tf.flags

**SimpleApproximation** - uses a simple 1 hidden layer neural network to approximate an arbitrary function.
